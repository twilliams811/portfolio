Bio:
 I am a girl who codes from New York. I currently attend Saint Vincent Ferrer High School, i will be in the 11th grade in the fall, and I am looking forward to taking the SAT, and taking college courses. I live at home with my mom, my sisters, and my dad. When I'm not coding, you can find me listening to music, studying science or doing homework. On my free time i love to dance and take pictures.
